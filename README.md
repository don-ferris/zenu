# Zenu (Pie Menu Desktop Environment)
Minimalistic, profoundly uncluttered desktop environment using pop-up pie menus in lieu of start buttons, task bars, panels, menu bars, tool bars, and context/right-click menus

Zenu
* Simple and uncluttered; most standard screen elements go away â€” no more start menu, panels, title bars, menu bars, toolbars, min/max/restore buttons - just a super clean, uncluttered screen with a pop-up pie menu that appears with a keyboard/mouse shortcut.
* Much less cursor movement - the (context sensitive) menu pops up, centered on the cursor, wherever you right click (If cursor is near the edge of the screen, it is automatically relocated in order to allow the pie menu to be fully displayed with the cursor in the center of the pie menu)
* Highly customizable appearance - skinnable, color schemes, with/out icons and/or keyboard shortcut definitions
